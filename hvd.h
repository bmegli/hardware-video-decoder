/**
 * @struct hvd_config
 * @brief Decoder configuration.
 *
 * The hardware can be one of:
 * - vaapi
 * - vdpau
 * - dxva2
 * - d3d11va
 * - videotoolbox
 * - cuda (for Nvidia NVDEC/CUVID)
 *
 * The device can be:
 * - NULL (select automatically)
 * - point to valid device e.g. "/dev/dri/renderD128" for vaapi
 *
 * The codec (should be supported by your hardware):
 * - h264
 * - hevc
 * - vp8
 * - vp9
 * - ...
 * - h264_cuvid (Nvidia NVDEC/CUVID decoder)
 * - hevc_cuvid (Nvidia NVDEC/CUVID decoder)
 * - ...
 *
 * When using Nvidia (hardware == "cuda") you need to specify codec as "[codec]_cuvid" (e.g. "h264_cuvid")
 *
 * The pixel_format is format you want to receive data in.
 * Only hardware conversions are supported. If you select
 * something unsupported by hardware, the library will dump for you
 * list of supported pixel formats to standard error. From my experience
 * even those reported are not supported in all scenarios.
 *
 * Nvidia cuvid (h264_cuvid, hevc_cuvid, ...) has a quirk.
 * If you select pixel format unsupported by hardware it will silently
 * return data in nv12 (or p010le, p016le, ... depending on bit depth)
 * The frame format may still be set to what you requested.
 *
 * Typical examples:
 * - nv12
 * - yuv420p (this is generally safe choice)
 * - rgb0
 * - bgr0
 * - ...
 *
 * For pixel format explanation see:
 * <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/3.4/pixfmt_8h.html#a9a8e335cf3be472042bc9f0cf80cd4c5">FFmpeg pixel formats</a>
 *
 * You typically don't have to specify width, height and profile (leave as 0) but some codecs need this information.
 *
 * For width and height the decoder may overwrite your values while parsing the data.
 * It is not safe to assume that width/height of decoded frame matches what you supplied.
 *
 * For possible profiles see:
 * <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/3.4/avcodec_8h.html#ab424d258655424e4b1690e2ab6fcfc66">FFmpeg profiles</a>
 *
 * For H.264 profile can typically be:
 * - FF_PROFILE_H264_CONSTRAINED_BASELINE
 * - FF_PROFILE_H264_MAIN
 * - FF_PROFILE_H264_HIGH
 * - ...
 *
 * For HEVC profile can typically be:
 * - FF_PROFILE_HEVC_MAIN
 * - FF_PROFILE_HEVC_MAIN_10 (10 bit channel precision)
 * - ...
 *
 * @see hvd_init
